      <p>
        I'm originally from Peru but raised in Massachusetts. I moved to Georgia
        a few years ago and I'm currently enrolled in the Georgia-Tech Boot
        Camp. Prior to this camp I had completed a 3 week workshop program
        called "SheCodes". The program provided a basic introduction to
        front-end development as well as development tools. The subjects covered
        in the program were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My goal moving forward is
        to continue expanding my knowledge on the different coding concepts in
        software development.
